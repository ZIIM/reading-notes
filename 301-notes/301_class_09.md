[Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)
1. What is functional programming?
> it's an approach to coding that treats computations as math-like functions. It emphasizes immutable data, pure functions, and avoiding side effects.

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
> A pure function consistently produces the same output for a given input and doesn't have side effects. It relies solely on inputs and doesn't alter external factors.

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
> predictability, simplified testing, and secure parallel processing since they don't rely on shared state.

4. What is immutability?
> data that can't be modified after creation, enhancing stability and predictability

5. What is Referential transparency?
> it allows you to replace a function call with its result without changing a program's behavior, promoting clarity and simplification


[Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHLd36QoS4k)
1. What is a module?
> A module is a self-contained code unit that contains functions and data.

2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
> `require()` is used to import external modules into code.

3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
> `import` or `require`

4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
> `To make a module accessible, export the elements you intend to share.`
