## Notes

### MongoDB
- run it with `mongod`

### Express server installation
- `npm install express cors dotenv mongoose nodemon`
- scripts add start args `start: node server.js`

### React install
- npm create vite@latest
- npm install bootstrap axios react-bootstrap
- atlas username/ password: sugaraspa/ 66SKR98f5kPTKujN
- into my api to talk to mongoose:(in .env)
  `MONGODB_URL=mongodb+srv://sugaraspa:<password>@cluster0.wlju2vn.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority`

1. 5 Differences Between noSQL and SQL:


| Feature                      | SQL Databases                                                                       | NoSQL Databases                                                                      |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data Model                   | SQL databases are relational and table-based.                                       | NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, graph databases, or wide-column stores. This means they don't adhere to a standard schema. |
| Scalability                  | SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, meaning you increase the power of a single server.  | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, meaning you add more servers in the pool of resources to handle more traffic.                      |
| Query Language               | SQL databases use the structured query language (SQL), which is powerful and standardized.  | NoSQL databases often lack a standard query language, sometimes referred to as UnQL. Their query capabilities are not as powerful as SQL.      |
| Complex Queries              | SQL is good for complex queries and is designed for environments where these are common.  | NoSQL databases are generally not suitable for complex queries. The interfaces for complex queries are not standardized.                        |
| Support                      | SQL databases typically have robust vendor and community support, as well as a large number of independent consultants.  | Support for NoSQL databases might be less comprehensive, often relying on community support or fewer experts.                                   |
Here are the answers in markdown format:

2. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
> Data with structured schemas and relationships that can be represented in tables with rows and columns. 

3. Give a real world example.
> Customer information for an ecommerce site, with structured data like name, address, order history etc that relate to each other through foreign keys.

4. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?  
> Unstructured or semi-structured data without rigid schemas, such as documents, key-value pairs, graphs etc.

5. Give a real world example.
> Comments or posts on a social media site, which can have varied structures and fields depending on the content.

6. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
> NoSQL databases like MongoDB are good for hierarchical data storage as they can hold JSON-like documents with nested objects and arrays.

7. Which type of database is best for scalability?
> NoSQL databases are more horizontally scalable by adding servers to a cluster. SQL scaling vertically is limited by hardware.

1. What does SQL stand for?
> Structured Query Language
2. What is a relational database?
> a database that uses SQL and stores data in tables with rows and columns
3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?
> A relational database works with tables as the structure to store data
4. What is a ‘schema’?
> A schema defines the fields or columns that can exist in a database table. All rows in that table must adhere to the schema.
5. What is a NoSQL database?
> A NoSQL database is a non-relational database that does not use SQL. Examples are MongoDB, DynamoDB.
6. How does it work?
> NoSQL databases work with collections and documents rather than tables and rows. Documents can have varied, flexible structures.
8. What is inside of a MongoDB database?
> MongoDB databases contain collections which hold documents.
9. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
> MongoDB is more flexible since documents can have varying fields. SQL requires fixed schemas
10. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
> A disadvantage of NoSQL is potential for inconsistent data since documents vary. Joins between data are also harder.
