1. What is an expression in JavaScript?
    * an expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and functions that evaluates to a resulting value. Expressions can be as simple as a single variable or constant, or they can be more complex with multiple components.

2. What would we use a loop in our code?
    * to execute a block of code repeatedly for a certain number of iterations or until a specific condition is met. Loops allow you to automate repetitive tasks and process data efficiently. 

3. When does a 'for' loop stop executing?
    * a for loop stops executing when the condition specified in the loop declaration evaluates to false.

4. How many times will a 'while' loop execute?
    * depends on the condition specified in the loop. The loop will continue to execute as long as the condition evaluates to true. If the condition initially evaluates to false, the loop will not execute at all.
