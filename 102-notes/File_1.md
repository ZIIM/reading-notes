## What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

  1. code completion;
  2. syntax highlighting
  3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
  4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

## What do the following commands do?
  
  1. pwd = Full path to working directory
  2. ls = Short listing
  3. cd = Home directory
  4. mkdir = Create new directory
  5. touch = Create a new file

## Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
  
  1. cd projects = will change directory to projects
  2. mkdir new-project = adds a new directory named new project
  3. touch new-project/newfile.md = a new file will be added named newfile.md under new-project
  4. cd .. = changes to parent directory
  5. ls projects/new-project = shows a list of files and folders within new-project file
