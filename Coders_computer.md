What are four important features to look for in a text editor?

  1.) code completion; 
  2.) syntax highlighting
  3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue)
  4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them

* What do the following commands do?
 pwd = Full path to working directory
 ls = Short listing
 cd = Home directory
 mkdir = Create new directory
 touch = Create a new file
* Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
 cd projects = will change directory to projects
 mkdir new-project = adds a new directory named new project
 touch new-project/newfile.md = a new file will be added named newfile.md under new-project 
 cd .. = changes to parent directory 
 ls projects/new-project = shows a list of files and folders within new-project file
