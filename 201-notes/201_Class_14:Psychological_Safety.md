    * first tour to the middle east i was assigned to a 3 man team, myself, riley and jones. We were all the same rank and held the same position we worked well together since neither of us had been deployed and all of us jokingly had no clue what we were doing, after about 2 weeks of being together, eating together, working together and struggling together we became very comfortable with communicationing what we didnt know and by doing so one of us in the group generally had some understanding of the issue and we would bounce solutions off of each other until something worked. all of the key factors stated in the first question payed a role in that team. To this day we all talk and help each other.
