    A GIF image is like a moving picture or a short video clip. It consists of a series of frames that play in a loop, creating a sense of animation. You might have seen GIFs on social media platforms or in messages. They are often used to express emotions or share funny moments.

    On the other hand, an SVG image is more like a drawing or a piece of artwork. It is created using code and is based on shapes, lines, and curves.

## Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.
    * The foreground and background colors of an HTML element refer to the colors used for the text and the area behind the text, respectively. Let me explain it in simple terms:

    Imagine you have a piece of paper with some writing on it. The foreground color is like the color of the pen you use to write the text. It determines how the text itself appears, such as whether it's black, blue, or any other color you choose. It's the color that you see for the actual words.

    On the other hand, the background color is like the color of the paper itself. It sets the color for the area behind the text. You can choose any color you like for the background, such as white, yellow, or even a pattern or image. It's the color that fills the space around the text.

    By selecting different foreground and background colors, you can make the text stand out and create various visual effects on your webpage. It's like choosing the color of your pen and the color of the paper to make the writing look attractive and easy to read.

    In HTML, you can specify the foreground color using CSS properties like color, and the background color using properties like background-color. These properties allow you to customize the appearance of text and create visually appealing webpages.
