# 201 Reading Notes


## Getting Started

1. Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
    * Through cyberspace it flies,
HTTP, a data ally,
Requests and responses, it carries,
Connecting computers, no boundaries.

With URLs as its guide,
Data traverses far and wide,
TCP ensures a secure ride,
As HTTP bridges the digital divide.

2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
    * HTML Parsing:
        * The browser begins by fetching the HTML file from the server based on the provided URL.
        * The HTML file is then parsed by the browser's HTML parser.
        * The parser reads the HTML markup from top to bottom and construct a tree-like structure called the Document Object Moduel (DOM). The DOm represents the hierarchical structure of the HTML elements.
        * During the parsing process, the browser resolves any external resourses referenced in the HTML, such as CSS and JacaScript files, by making additional requests to the server.

    *  CSS Parsing:
        * After the HTML parsing is complete, the browser fetches and parses the CSS files referenced in the HTML.
        * The CSS parser reads the CSS rules and selectors, creating a CSS Object Model (CSSOM).
        * The CSSOM is then combined with the DOM to create the Render Tree, which represents how the elements will be rendered on the screen.
        * The browser applies the CSS styles to the appropriate elements based on the selectoes and builds the final rendering tree.
    * JavaScript Parsing:
        * Once the HTML and CSS parsing are finished, the browser fetches and parses the JavaScript files referenced in the HTML.
        * The JavaScript parser reads and executes the JavaScript code, generating executable instructions.
        * As the JavaScript code executes, it can interact with the DOM CSSOM, modify elements, handle events, and perform various operations to enhance the functionality and interactivity of the web page.
        * JavaScript execution may be synchronous or asynchronous, depending on the code structure and any explicit delays or event handling involved.


3. How can you find images to add to a Website?
    * Stock Photo Websites, Free Image Libraries, Own Photography, Google Image Search (with Proper Usage Rights)

4. How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
    * To create a string, you can use quotation marks (single or double) to define the text content. To create a number, you can simply assign a numerical value to a variable.

5. What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?
    * A variable is a named container that holds a value. They are important for multiple reasons: Data storage, Vaule Manipulation, Data Sharing. Code Readability, Flexibility and Adaptability.


## Introduction to HTML

1. What is an HTML attribute?
    * A characteristic or property that provides additional information about an HTML element.

2. Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
    * It represents different parts of a document and defines the structure and content within a web page. Each HTML element consists of several components, including the opening tag, closing tag (in most cases), attributes, and content.

3. What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
    * The <article> element is used to define a self-contained, standalone piece of content, such as a blog post or news article, that can be distributed or shared independently. On the other hand, the <section> element is used to group related content together within a document, creating logical divisions or sections.

4. What Elements does a “typical” website include?
    * 'Header, Nav bar, main content, side bar, footer'

5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
    * It provides information to search engines about the content and context of a web page.

6. How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?
    * The <meta> HTML tag is used to specify metadata, which provides information about a web page to search engines, browsers, and other web-related systems.
