Domain Modeling

Explain why we need domain modeling.
HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
    * Accessibility, maintainability, performance 

2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML 
table tag.
    *  <caption>: The <caption> element is used to provide a title or caption for an HTML table. 
    * <th>: The <th> element represents a header cell within an HTML table. It is used to mark up header content, such as column or row headings.
    * <tbody> (Table Body): Contains the main data rows of the table, excluding header and footer rows.

Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
    * A constructor in JavaScript is a special function used to create and initialize objects. It is called with the new keyword to create instances of objects based on a blueprint defined by the constructor function. 

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
    * When this is used within an object literal (also known as an object initializer), it refers to the object itself that is currently being defined. It allows you to access and modify the properties and methods of the object.

Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
    * Prototype: The post office has a standard package handling procedure, which serves as a prototype for all packages. This procedure contains the common steps and instructions that apply to all packages, such as checking the destination, weighing the package, and selecting the appropriate delivery method.
    * Inheritance: When you receive a new package, you follow the standard package handling procedure (prototype) as a base. Then, depending on the specific package's characteristics, you might add additional steps or adapt the procedure to ensure it gets delivered correctly. Each package inherits the fundamental processing steps from the prototype but can have unique attributes based on its type.
