1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
    * Since the early 2000s, the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved significantly, thanks to technological advancements and the development of web standards.

2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
    * The src attribute stands for "source" and is used to specify the URL or file path of the video file that should be played. 
    * The controls attribute is a boolean attribute that, when present, adds playback controls to the video player.

3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
    * It is important to have fallback content inside the <video> element because not all web browsers support the <video> tag or all video formats.

4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
    * In the 41st millennium on Technorium Prime, where advanced technology and ancient magic coalesce, Audio and Video stood as sentient beings of boundless creativity. Audio, the celestial bard, possessed the ability to weave cosmic symphonies that resonated with the stars themselves, channeling the energy of the universe through harmonious melodies. Video, the ethereal sorcerer, harnessed the power of light and shadows to craft mesmerizing holographic spectacles, revealing forgotten tales from distant galaxies. As emissaries of art and knowledge, they traversed the cosmos, sharing their cosmic creations with civilizations far and wide, leaving awe and inspiration in their wake, and becoming the cosmic bards of Technorium Prime.

A Complete Guide To Grid

1. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
    * Layout Model:
        Flexbox: One-dimensional layout for arranging items in a row or column.
        Grid Layout: Two-dimensional layout for creating grid structures with rows and columns.
    * Direction:
        Flexbox: Works in a single direction, either row or column.
        Grid Layout: Allows placement of items both horizontally and vertically.
    * Responsive Layout:
        Flexbox: Best for dynamic content reordering and responsive designs.
        Grid Layout: Great for complex, responsive multi-dimensional layouts.
    * Alignment:
        Flexbox: Powerful alignment along main and cross axes.
        Grid Layout: More precise control over alignment for rows and columns.

2. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences.
    * Grid Container: In CSS Grid Layout, the grid container is the parent element that contains grid items. It is defined using the display: grid; property. The grid container establishes the grid formatting context and determines the overall layout structure. All direct children of the grid container become grid items.

    * Grid Item: Grid items are the child elements of the grid container that participate in the grid layout. They are placed inside the grid cells and can span across multiple rows and columns. Grid items can be positioned and sized using grid-specific properties like grid-row, grid-column, grid-area, etc.

    * Grid Line: Grid lines are imaginary lines that divide the grid into rows and columns. They form the structure of the grid, allowing you to position and align grid items. Rows have horizontal grid lines, and columns have vertical grid lines. You can refer to grid lines using numerical indices or names defined for specific rows or columns. For example, the first horizontal grid line is the start of the first row, and the second vertical grid line is the start of the second column.

Responsive Images

1. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?
    * Developers should make images responsive to improve site performance, reduce loading times, optimize bandwidth usage, enhance accessibility, and provide a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

2. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
    * The srcset attribute is used in the <img> tag to provide the browser with a list of image sources with different resolutions or sizes. It allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on the user's device and screen resolution. The browser selects the image that best fits the available space, ensuring the website loads faster and is more responsive.
    
    * The sizes attribute specifies the size of the image's display area on the webpage. It works in conjunction with the srcset attribute to help the browser make better decisions about which image to fetch and display. The sizes attribute is used to tell the browser how the image will be displayed relative to the viewport width.

    * <img src="example.jpg"
     srcset="example-small.jpg 320w,
             example-medium.jpg 640w,
             example-large.jpg 1024w"
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw,
            (max-width: 1024px) 50vw,
            25vw"
     alt="Example Image"> 

3. How is srcset more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript?
    * srcset is more helpful for responsive images than CSS or JavaScript because it allows the browser to automatically select the most appropriate image based on the user's device and screen resolution, leading to better performance, simpler implementation, and future-proofing without the need for custom code in CSS or JavaScript.
