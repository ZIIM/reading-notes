What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
    * A syntax error relates to mistakes in the code's structure, causing it to fail during compilation or execution, while a logic error relates to flaws in the code's algorithm or decision-making process, leading to unexpected or incorrect output even though the code runs without errors.

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?
    * The JavaScript Debugger is a tool that helps developers find and fix problems in their code. It allows you to pause the code's execution, inspect variables, and step through the code to understand how it runs. It's like a detective for your code.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.
    * breakpoint is a specific point in the code where the developer instructs the debugger to pause the execution of the program.

3. What is the call stack?
    * A call stack is a data structure used by the JavaScript engine to keep track of function calls during the execution of a program. It operates on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, meaning the last function called is the first one to be resolved.
