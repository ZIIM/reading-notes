JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?
    * In JavaScript, an object is like a container that holds different pieces of information related to a specific thing. Think of it as a virtual box where you can put in various items, and each item is labeled with a unique name, known as a property. These properties can hold different types of data, such as text, numbers, or even other objects. So, an object is a handy way to organize and store different pieces of information about something in one place.

2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?
    *  Simplicity and readability, no need for constructors, easy property initialization, fast object creation

3. How do objects differ from arrays?
    * objects use curly braces {} arrays use square brackets []

4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.
    * You would need to use bracket notation to access an object's property when the property name contains special characters, spaces, or when it is a dynamically generated value (i.e., stored in a variable).

5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?
    * object literal

const dog = {
  name: 'Spot',
  age: 2,
  color: 'white with black spots',
  humanAge: function (){
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age*7} in human years`);
  }
}
